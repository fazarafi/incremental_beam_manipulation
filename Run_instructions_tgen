To regen cvs:
delete cvs file - they will be generated from the "all-*.txt" files
run make cv in terminal from tgen/bagel-data/input

to regen all-*.txt files
delete all-*.txt files, they will be regenerated from ACL10-inform-training.txt file
run make cv in terminal from tgen/bagel-data/input

To run training of model:
./run_tgen.py seq2seq_train /Users/james_hargreaves/PycharmProjects/partIII-Project/tgen/bagel-data/config/seq2seq.py /Users/james_hargreaves/PycharmProjects/partIII-Project/tgen/bagel-data/input/cv00/train-das.txt /Users/james_hargreaves/PycharmProjects/partIII-Project/tgen/bagel-data/input/cv00/train-text.txt models/model.pickle.gz
(note that this only does the cv0 training)

To test the model
./run_tgen.py seq2seq_gen -w out-text.txt -b 1 model.pickle.gz /Users/james_hargreaves/PycharmProjects/partIII-Project/tgen/bagel-data/data/training2/cv00/test-das.txt
(again note that this only does the testing for cv0)
this generate a text file output
to get the result we run get_bleu_score.py
